# Learnings from the Job Hunt

I got laid off of my job as a Senior Software Engineer at IBM Research after 10+ years of service in early November 2025. I was working in the AI space when AI was at its peak and thought I was safe. But my entire team, two surrounding teams and some thousands of other employees were let go. Fortunately, I had the support of so many of them and of others in my network. I don't know how I can ever repay some of them, but I decided to write this up as a small means of paying it forward.

## Applying

### The Dark Hole of Despair
Maybe **THE** best advice I got was to stay the hell out of the LinkedIn feed. The algorithm knows your desperation and serves you posts from people who have been searching for jobs for five years, people applying to fifty jobs a week, people detailing how terrible the job market is. Then there are the recruiters who post some contradictory advice, tell you how you're doing it all wrong and that for the low low price of X they can help you land a job in a week. Obviously not all posts are like this. Most are probably true and terrible stories or posts from recruiters who genuinely want to help and are in fact helpful. But they are also not healthy for someone in a fragile state who is already having trouble sleeping and getting out of bed in the morning. So I actively avoided it. I even set out to build myself a custom feed, but the LinkedIn filtering and API are limiting, and web scrapers violate the terms of service and can get you booted from the platform for life. So I just had to be disciplined enough to avoid it.

### Networking
All of that said, LinkedIn is an indispensable tool. I didn't realize this until [Béatrice Moissinac](https://www.linkedin.com/in/beabytes/) sent me her [blog post](https://beabytes.com/seafaring-part-iii/) about using its graph to your advantage. I connected with anyone and everyone and after I made my layoff announcement, I got over a thousand profile impressions. These actions got me introductions to an array of different folks and put me into two interview pipelines. I didn't turn down any chance to meet with any recruiter, employee offering advice, or old colleague checking in. I also exhausted myself - and I consider myself to be a very social person! I had to pace myself.

### Connections
I found a job with Duolingo that really piqued my interest. My job coach suggested I find someone in my network who works there and try to introduce myself and/or find out who the hiring manager is. A former colleague was a second connection to a VP so I asked for an introduction which he kindly arranged. I didn't make it past the application screening, but it was a good exercise in not being afraid to do this. Both my former colleague and the VP seemed glad to help. 

Another example of using connections was actually without LinkedIn. I had found my job at IBM Research online somewhere but worried that the job portal was a black hole (and it is - as I learned after working there). A colleague knew someone who interned for the hiring manager and through this connection my information was sent directly to the manager. He and I worked together for my ten years at IBM and we would have worked another twenty together if not for the layoff.

### Cold Applying
So many LinkedIn posts (that I saw before my boycott) talked about how you should never "cold apply" to a position - that is apply directly through the job portal. You should find out who the hiring manager is and send directly. But I had zero connections to help me get one of two positions I saw posted for the New York Times. I "cold" applied to both, and actually got a call back for both, and into the final round for one while pausing the other. Not all companies will ghost you if you use their portal.

## Interview preparation

I found LLMs to be invaluable for the interview process. My process was to take the job description and any notes I took from the recruiters about the interview process and ask the LLM (Sonnet 4.5 or GPT 5.2 in my case) to generate 6-12 questions I might be asked in the interview. I would answer each question in one of two ways: either writing out an answer, or speaking my answers and using ChatGPT's dictation feature for speech to text.

I'd then pass the answer to the LLM and ask it to critique the answer. Without any more detail in the prompt, it would give me a list of strengths, weaknesses, improved answers suggestions and a grade on a ten point scale. I then rewrote my answers based on the feedback and kept all question-answer pairs in a document to study like a script. 

I have the memory of a goldfish. I struggle to remember the details of projects I did even just a year ago because I'm juggling twenty tasks at any given time. So one huge advantage of this preparation was getting to craft an accurate and detailed answer to a prompt like "Walk through the details of an end-to-end project you architected and justify why you made each choice you did." Answering this outside of a real interview scenario meant I could bring up the code repository, have the dependencies jog my memory and formulate a solid response. This was also helpful for more behavioral questions, such as, "Describe a time when someone you worked with had dramatically different viewpoints than you." You'll probably find as I did that some examples are better or more appropriate than others. There were also example questions that did not apply to my experience, like "What’s your experience with Terraform or infrastructure as code?" The LLM guided me to formulate a professional response.

The interview format du jour is the STAR or SAR method: Situation - (Task) - Action - Result. They want to hear quantified metrics if you have them. This is another situation where having time to look through documents and records to formulate the answer ahead of the interview was extremely helpful.

As I say, recall is hard for me, especially under the pressure of an interview. The job coach I was working with had a brilliant suggestion which worked for me in a couple of instances where studying my scripts wasn't enough. She suggested a spreadsheet with a column for each STAR item, with each row having some key bullets from the original answer. I learned that many interviewees are using an AI-powered app that listens to the interviewer during the interview and generates answers for the interviewee to read. Fearing I might be suspected of this, I simply shared my screen, so the interviewer could see I was looking at something that I had created. I don't believe this detracted from the interview in any way.

If I had to give a number, I'd say 85% of the questions the LLM generated appeared in some form in the ~12 interviews I sat in. It's possible interviewers are using LLMs to generate the questions, but also I think there's only so many general questions pertaining to a position that one can ask. None of the questions I was asked were word for word what the LLM came up with, but still, having written/spoken about it in practice helped my fluency and recall in the real interview.
